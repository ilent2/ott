function [Aperp,Apar] = perpcomponent( A, n )
% PERPCOMPONENT finds perpendicular (and optionally) parallel
% components of a vector relative to a reference vector.
%
% perp_component = PERPCOMPONENT(A,n) calculates perpendicular component
% of row vector A or Nx3 matrix A of vectors.  n is the reference vector.
%
% [perp_component,parallel_component] = PERPCOMPONENT(A,n) calculates
% perpendicular and parallel components.

% Make n a unit vector
nmag = dot(n,n,2);

% The order in the dot product matters: the complex conjugate of
% the first term is used. Since we might want complex A ...
