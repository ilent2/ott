ott - Optical Tweezers Toolbox
==============================

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/123386773.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/123386773)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ott/badge/?version=latest)](https://ott.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The optical tweezers toolbox can be used to calculate optical forces
and torques of particles using the T-matrix formalism in a vector
spherical wave basis.
The toolbox includes codes for calculating T-matrices, beams described
by vector spherical wave functions, functions for calculating forces
and torques, simple codes for simulating dynamics and examples.

Installation
------------

To use the toolbox, download or clone the GitHub repository.
You will also need a modern version of MATLAB, we recommend
updating to at least 2018a.
You may also need some of the Matlab support packages (list comming soon).
This version of the toolbox is released as a package, `+ott`, which
contains a collection of functions for calculating T-matrices, beam
coefficients, force and torques.
To use the functions in your code, the easiest way is to add the
directory containing the package to your path,

```matlab
addpath('<download-path>/ott');
help ott   % Test that ott was found, should display ott Contents page
```

if you regularly use the toolbox you might want to add the command to
your [startup.m](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html?searchHighlight=startup.m) file.

Getting started
---------------

The toolbox has changed a lot since previous releases.
To get started, take a look at the [documentation over on read the docs](https://ott.readthedocs.io).
The documentation source can be found in the [docs](docs) directory or
you can download a PDF copy of the documentation with the latest release.
Alternatively, take a look at the [examples directory](examples).

To calculate the force on a spherical particle, you need to setup a beam obejct,
setup a particle and run the `ott.forcetorque` function.
One of the shortest examples of this is:
```matlab
beam = ott.BscPmGauss();
tmatrix = ott.TmatrixMie(0.5, 'k_medium', 2*pi, 'k_particle', 2*pi*1.3);
fz = ott.forcetorque(beam, tmatrix, 'position', [0;0;1].*linspace(-8, 8));
figure(), plot(fz.')
```
this assumes everything is in units of the wavelength, and creates a Gaussian
beam with the default parameters.

Recent changes
--------------

There have been many changes since the previous release, mainly the switch
to object orientated programming.  Beams and T-matrices are now represented
by obects, we have added shape objects and moved everything into packages.

T-matrices are represented by `Tmatrix` objects.  For simple shapes,
the `Tmatrix.simple` method can be used to construct T-matrices for
a variety of common objects.
More complex T-matrices can be generated by inheriting the T-matrix
class, for an example, take a look at TmatrixMie and TmatrixPm.

Beams are represented by a `Bsc` objects.  A beam can be multiplied
by T-matrices or other matrix/scalar values to generate new beams.
For Gaussian type beams, including Hermite-Gauss, Ince-Gauss, and
Laguarre-Gaussian beams, the `BscPmGauss` class provides the
equivalent of `bsc_pointmatch_farfield` in the previous release.

The new implementation hides `Nmax`, most routines have a default
choice of `Nmax` based on the beam/particle size.  `Nmax` can still
be accessed and changed manually, but in most cases the automatic
choice of `Nmax` should be fine.
Beams can T-matrices can be multiplied without needing to
worry about the having equal `Nmax`, the beam/T-matrix will be
expanded to match the maximum `Nmax`.
If repeated calculations are being done, it may be faster to first
ensure the `Nmax` of the beam and T-matrix match, this is done in
`forcetorque` when the position or rotation arguments are used.

Upcoming release
----------------

* Version 2 will introduces a focus on simulating particles in
  optical traps rather than just focussing on calculating optical
  forces and torques.  The plan is also to introduce geometric
  optics and other methods not requiring a T-matrix.  The toolbox
  will be more automated and include a graphical user interface.
* Version 1.6 we may move Beams and Tmatrices to a beams and tmatrix
  sub-package.  We might also add drag calculation codes.
